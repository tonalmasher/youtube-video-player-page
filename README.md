### YouTube Video Player Page recreated for HTML / CSS learning via the Odin Project

This is my first HTML page built using CSS Grid. Definitely learned some about it, but got bogged down in other aspects.

Still need to hone in my skills on nav bars / floats and the like.

Also user the material icon set from Google.

I tried to write the CSS myself, and got help through online tutorials and information from various sites. Despite trying to simplify, I still ended up with a lot of CSS.
